This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
## About this project

De-pay is a decentralized application that facilitates any company or individual to pay the salary of their employees in ethereum with just a click of a button. This application cuts down the necessary resources for anyone to pay their employees and will be significantly more efficient.

TechStack -  The frontend of this application is made using Next.js (framework of the React.js library )and tailwindcss (a CSS framework). The backend of this application is a smart contract written in Solidity (a contract oriented language used to write smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain)which is deployed on the Mumbai Testnet using Hardhat.

The smart contract is connected to the frontend using the Web3Modal library which allows our application to support multiple web3 providers such as Metamask.
